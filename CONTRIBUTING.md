Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

-   Beginner issues `beginner` - issues which should only require a few lines of code or writing.
-   Help wanted issues `help-wanted` - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for `superfundr`, including completely new contributions and minor improvements to existing workshops, the website, promotional material, or resources. Following these guidelines helps the project leads and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag\_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion).

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

-   **Determine [which repository the enhancement should be suggested in](#superfundr).**
-   **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Asuperfundr)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#superfundr) your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

-   **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
-   **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
-   **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
-   **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
-   **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to `superfundr`.
-   **List some other events or applications where this enhancement exists.**
